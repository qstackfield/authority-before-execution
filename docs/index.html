      <h1>Authority Before Execution</h1>
      <p class="subtitle">
        An evaluation-first control plane for autonomous agents.
      </p>
      <p class="thesis">
        If explicit authority is not present at execution time,
        the next state does not exist.
      </p>
    </header>

      <h2>Why This Exists</h2>
      <p>
        Most agent governance systems analyze behavior <em>after</em> execution.
        Logs are reviewed post-incident. Responsibility is inferred retroactively.
        Safety is narrated, not enforced.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project takes the opposite stance:
        <strong>authority is bound before execution</strong>,
        responsibility is explicit, and outcomes are measured continuously.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The Core Invariant</h2>
      <div class="invariant">
        <code>
          No authority at execution time → no state change
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>
        Agents may reason freely. They may propose actions.
        But execution is a gated, observable, and measurable boundary.
      </p>
    </section>

      <h2>Execution Flow</h2>
      <pre class="diagram">
User Task
  ↓
Agent (Reasoning + Proposal)
  ↓
Evaluation + Trace (Opik)
  ↓
Authority Gate
├─ Approved → Execute → Outcome Traced
└─ Denied   → Block   → Denial Traced
      </pre>
      <p class="caption">
        Execution is impossible without a valid, scoped, time-bound authority artifact
        at the moment of commit.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What Is Measured</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Execution allow / deny rate</li>
        <li>Denial reason distribution</li>
        <li>Expired or missing authority attempts</li>
        <li>Out-of-scope authority usage</li>
        <li>Overbroad authority detection</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Governance quality is treated as a measurable system property,
        not a philosophical claim.

      <h2>Experiments & Artifacts</h2>
      <p>
        This repository includes reproducible experiments and concrete artifacts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="../demo/EXPERIMENT.md">Experiment Design</a> -
          how governed vs ungoverned executions were compared
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="../demo/sample_decision.json">Sample Decision</a> -
          the canonical execution input
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="../demo/sample_execution_result.json">Sample Execution Result</a> -
          the resulting execution artifact
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All executions are traced and evaluated using <strong>Opik</strong>,
        treating observability as a first-class primitive.
      </p>

      <h2>What This Is Not</h2>
      <p>
        This is not a full platform, UI, or orchestration layer.
        It intentionally avoids:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Role-based access control systems</li>
        <li>Approval user interfaces</li>
        <li>Policy DSLs</li>
        <li>Multi-agent coordination</li>
        <li>Production deployment concerns</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The goal is clarity, not scale.
      </p>

      <h2>Hackathon Context</h2>
      <p>
        This project was built for the
        <strong>Encode “Commit To Change” AI Agents Hackathon</strong>
        with a focus on <strong>Best Use of Opik</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It demonstrates how evaluation and observability can be used
        to enforce governance <em>before</em> execution,
        not merely analyze failures afterward.

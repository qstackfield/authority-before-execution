## Artifact layout

- `corpus/` contains runtime-generated artifacts produced by demos.
- `curated/` contains hand-selected examples referenced in documentation and judging.

Artifacts are always generated at execution time by the executor.
The website is a read-only inspection surface over this data.

# Execution Artifacts

This directory contains **execution-time evidence** produced by the
Authority Before Execution system.

These files are not examples, mocks, or simulations.
They are **immutable artifacts generated at runtime** by the execution gate.

If an artifact exists, an execution attempt occurred.
If it does not exist, no execution took place.

## `corpus/` — Full Execution Corpus

The `corpus/` directory contains the **complete set of execution attempts**
generated by the controlled variance demo.

Characteristics:
- One file per execution attempt
- Deterministic and reproducible
- Generated at execution time
- Never edited or post-processed

Each file represents a **single decision evaluated at the execution boundary**
against invariant `ABE-EXEC-001`.

This directory exists for:
- auditors
- evaluators
- anyone who wants the full dataset

---

## `curated/` — Canonical Proof Set

The `curated/` directory contains a **minimal, human-readable proof set**
selected from the full corpus.

Each file demonstrates **one distinct execution outcome class**.

This is the fastest way to understand what the system enforces.

### 01 - Expired Authority

`01-expired-authority.json`

Demonstrates:
- Authority was present
- Authority had expired
- Execution was **blocked**

This proves:
- Execution-time validation is enforced
- Replay and drift attacks fail deterministically

---

### 02 - Missing Authority

`02-missing-authority.json`

Demonstrates:
- No authority was bound
- Execution was **blocked**

This proves:
- The system fails closed
- Execution is impossible without explicit approval

---

### 03 - Scope Violation

`03-scope-violation.json`

Demonstrates:
- Authority was present
- Authority scope did not match the action
- Execution was **blocked**

This proves:
- Authority is not symbolic
- Scope is enforced at execution time

---

### 04 - Valid Authority

`04-valid-authority.json`

Demonstrates:
- Authority was present
- Scope matched the action
- Authority was unexpired
- Execution was **permitted**

This proves:
- Legitimate execution is possible
- The system does not block safe behavior

---

### 05 - Variance Example

`05-variance-example.json`

Demonstrates:
- One representative execution from a large variance run
- Realistic parameters
- Real enforcement outcome

This file exists to show:
- Scale does not change correctness
- The invariant holds across many executions

---

## Artifact Schema (High-Level)

Each artifact contains:

- `decision_id` — unique execution identifier
- `action` — requested state change
- `authority` — bound authority (or null)
- `execution_allowed` — true or false
- `deny_reason` — populated when blocked
- `enforcement_point` — execution boundary name
- `invariant_id` — enforced invariant
- `timestamp` — execution-time evaluation

These fields are written **at execution time**, not reconstructed later.

---

## Why This Matters

Most agent safety demos rely on:
- logs
- screenshots
- explanations
- post-hoc reasoning

This system produces **hard execution evidence**.

The artifacts in this directory answer one question conclusively:

> Was this execution allowed to happen?

No interpretation required.

---

## Important Notes

- Artifacts are generated at runtime
- They are intentionally committed for inspection
- They represent **proof**, not examples
- The system does not depend on UI interpretation

The UI and console only **render what already exists here**.

---

## Invariant Reference

All artifacts in this directory enforce:

**ABE-EXEC-001**

If explicit authority is not present, valid, and in scope at execution time,  
the state transition must not occur.

Everything else in the system is a corollary.

---

## How to Regenerate

To regenerate the corpus locally: python3 -m demo.run_variance –n 200 –seed 7

Artifacts will be written automatically under `docs/artifacts/`.

---

## Bottom Line

This directory is the system’s source of truth.

If you trust files more than narratives,
this is where the proof lives.
